# My name is Adam, welcome!

I'm currently a Front Line Manager working at Regatta Limited distribution centre and a coder at heart when and where I can.

### Management

I love working with people and supporting them throughout their careers. This is what drives me and helps spread the influence over.

### Coder

I dabble in different languaged and frameworks, primarily JavaScript, Java, Lua and Haxe. Love to prototype and experiment with new technologies.
