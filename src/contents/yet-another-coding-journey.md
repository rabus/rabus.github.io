### The Who

Hi ðŸ‘‹, my name is Adam and I would like to welcome you to my blog. I'm a proud father of twin girls and professionally work in logistics projects and change management for a clothing manufacturer.

In this blog, I would like to share my ideas and attempt to fix struggles or issues I stumble upon during my journey, document my progress and hopefully share something useful from the mix of my experiences and unique perspectives that each of us carries in our lives.

### The Why

After reading an n-th article about how someone started with coding and seeing their progress in the following posts I always wanted to do something similar, yet never given myself the confidence to do so.

There were always many "why not's" - that I've never written like this before or that it won't bring any value to the table, but this is irrelevant in the long run. After all, the worst thing that can happen is that no one will read it :).

### The What

I'm not an IT professional or a coder, or so I always defined myself as I never completed any official courses or don't have an IT-related job title (I work in logistics, in a project management role). The thing is, however, that I do code pretty much every day.

Whether it's using AutoHotkey scripting or Python to automate tasks, using code snippets in PowerApps within Office (365) or using TypeScript and Svelte to code a resource management app, I do, indeed, code.

This revelation didn't come to me easily, as I always assumed that this is "half-baked" and not enough to be able to call myself a coder.

Wrong - whilst it doesn't make me an expert, it means to me now that I am somewhere on the journey of potentially becoming one if I wish to and the only thing standing in my way is time and motivation.

### The How

The quality of content in this blog remains to be seen, however, I will strive to continue improving with both my writing style and choice of subjects, trying not to duplicate the mundane for the 1000th time. Throughout this, if you happen to read my posts, please do leave some feedback so it can be constructive for my progress.

For reference, some of the expected topics might include JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Svelte(Kit), PowerApps, Excel, PowerBI, PowerPoint and more.

In the meantime, thank you for tuning in and see you later.
